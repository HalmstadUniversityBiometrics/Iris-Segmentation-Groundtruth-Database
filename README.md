# Iris Segmentation Groundtruth Database


This repository contains Halmstad University´s release of the groundtruth data described in the paper
 is the original implementation of the paper **[A Ground Truth for Iris Segmentation](http://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?searchId=1&pid=diva2:710627)**, published at
[ICPR](http://www.icpr2014.org/) ([International Conference on Pattern Recognition](https://iapr.org/archives/icpr2014/)). 

Seminal experiments with this database can be found in the paper **[Near-infrared and visible-light periocular recognition with Gabor features using frequency-adaptive automatic eye detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08566)**, published at
[IET Biometrics Journal](https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-bmt.2014.0038).

# Background
**Segmentation is a critical part in iris recognition systems**, since errors in this initial stage are propagated to subsequent processing stages. Therefore, the performance of iris segmentation algorithms is paramount to the performance of the overall system. In order to properly evaluate and develop iris segmentation algorithm, especially under difficult conditions like off-angle and significant occlusions or bad lighting,  **it is beneficial to directly assess the segmentation algorithm**. Currently, when evaluating the performance of iris segmentation algorithms, this is  **mostly done by utilizing the recognition rate**, and consequently the overall performance of the biometric system. However, the overall recognition performance is not only affected by the segmentation accuracy, but also by the performance of the other subsystems based on possible suboptimal segmentation of the iris. As such it is  **difficult to differentiate between defects in the iris segmentation system and effects which might be introduced later**  in the system (you can read more about this phenomenon in our ICB 2013 publication  [here](http://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?searchId=2&pid=diva2:607425), which is summarized in the following figures).

# Dataset overview
For these reasons, with the purpose of allowing assessment of iris segmentation algorithms with independence of the whole biometric system, **we have generated an iris segmentation ground truth database**. We have segmented **a total of 12,621 iris images from 7 databases**. This data is now made publicly available, and can be used to analyse existing and test new iris segmentation algorithms. The iris segmentation database (**IRISSEG**) contains a mask for each iris image in form of parameters and a method to extract the mask. The database is partitioned into two datasets based on the shapes used for segmenting the iris and eyelid, the **CC and EP dataset**. For the CC dataset the parameters define circles which give the iris boundaries and eyelid maskings. For the EP dataset the parameters define ellipses for the iris and polynomials for the eyelid. Note that the eyelid parametrization was done in a way to ensure the best possible separation of iris and eyelids in the iris region, i.e. outside the iris region the parametrization is not necessarily accurate. Eyelashes occlusion is not included in the segmentation data. In addition, only iris segmentation data is provided in the IRISSEG dataset, not the original eye image databases, since they are not owned by us. A link to the actual iris databases is included in each case, please refer to them in order to obtain the original databases.

# Halmstad database of iris segmentation ground truth (IRISSEG-CC Dataset)
The parameters given in this dataset define circles (centre and radius) which give the iris boundaries and eyelid masks. Three points of each circle have been manually marked by an operator, which are used to compute the corresponding radius and centre. An example is as follows:

Ground truth segmentation data from the following databases are available in the IRISSEG-CC Dataset.

Please note that this repository only contains groundtruth data. We do not provide here the original iris databases, since we are not the owners of such databases (you must obtain them from their rightful owners). Below we provide links to the repositories of the iris databases for your convenience (we do not have control of the links to the original databases, please do a Google or similar search to try to find the database website if the links below do not work anymore).

**BioSec Multimodal Biometric Database Baseline (iris part)**
---
 - The BioSec database has 3,200 iris images of 640x480 pixels from 200 subjects acquired with a LG IrisAccess EOU3000 close-up infrared iris camera. Here, we use a subset comprising data from 75 subjects (totalling 1,200 iris images), for which iris and eyelids segmentation groundtruth is available.

**Casia Iris v3 Interval Database**
---
 - The CASIA-Iris-Interval subset of the CASIA v3.0 database, containing 2655 iris images of 320x280 pixels from 249 subjects, was fully segmented. Images were acquired with a close-up infrared iris camera in an indoor environment, having images with very clear iris texture details thanks to a circular NIR LED array.

**MobBIO Database (iris train dataset)**
---
 - The iris training subset of the MobBIO database, containing 800 images of 240x200 pixels from 100 subjects, was fully segmented. Images were captured with the Asus Eee Pad Transformer TE300T Tablet (webcam in visible light) in two different lightning conditions, with variable eye orientations and occlusion levels, resulting in a large variability of acquisition conditions. Distance to the camera was kept constant, however.
